		I've finished all the menus and polished everything up to get rid of the bugs and it's finally done. That's right, a stable working version of the game is out and you can play it now!
    <br><br>
    Visit the <a href="https://github.com/ennuuos/neath">github page</a> to download the game and be one of the first to play it.
