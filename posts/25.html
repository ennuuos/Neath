		After some consideration I decided to spend the afternoon migrating from a list
		based inventory to a grid based inventory. It worked pretty alright, although
		there were a few hiccoughs with figuring out where to render the items and also
		where the aforementioned rendered items where relative to the mouse (i.e. the
		mouse wasn't clicking) but it worked out well in the end. I set all the items to
		a picture of a candle because game-icons.net is blocked at school but when I get
		home I'm gonna set them all to the right things.
