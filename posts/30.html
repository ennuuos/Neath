		I've added more potions, specifically the penetrating sight and night vision
		potions. The first of which required me to fix a bug in which tooltips would not
		be displayed on world objects if a hero was selected. Well I fixed the bug and
		made it so the aforementioned tooltips only show up on chests and only when the
		hero has 'penetrating sight'. Night vision isn't actually working but the loot
		entity works.
