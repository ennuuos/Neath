		Unfortunately the potato had to go. I know, it's really sad. I couldn't find an
		appropriate icon from game-icons.net or anywhere else that fit the style so I've
		changed the 'generic food' found in the neath to an eggplant. Why an eggplant
		you ask? Because it was the most random food I could find at game-icons.net, that's
		why. That's not a good enough reason you say? Well I say I don't care. Deal with it.
