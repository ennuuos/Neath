		I just finished adding status effects. I've been sitting in my room all night just
		coding away. Now spiders can poison you and forification shows up in the top right
		(as well as poisoning). I also added health rings to enemies and health bars to players.
		I also added selection cycling, as in, when the user presses a button the game
		selects the next hero in the list (and loops at the end.)
