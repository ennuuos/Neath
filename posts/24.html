		Due to popular demand I've moved the inventory over to the right as opposed to
		smack bang in the middle of the screen. I also decided to add equipables instead
		of having chests full of just potatoes and treasure. Now the player can equip
		a weapon or defense and it'll show up with a little icon above the inventory list.
		The icon is from game-icons.net
