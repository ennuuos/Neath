		Day #2 of pathfinding aside from the plethora of crashes and errors it works.
		Sort of. I'll keep this short cause there's no progress but basically:<br>
		- I can make it calculate a path from one coordinate to another based on the map<br>
		- It takes a s*** load of time because I haven't actually used A* yet<br>
		- By a lot of time I mean like a quarter second but that's still substantial<br>
		- It keeps on doing stupid things and not working<br>
