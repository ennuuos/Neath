		Lighting works. Slow as hell but it works. I'm gonna have to optimize it a bit
		but that's okay. I basically get the distance from all the heroes and get the
		inverse square of it to find the 'luminance' of that specific tile. (inverse
		square is the proper function to calculate light intensity [it's a physics thing])
