A turn based adventure game built with love.

This was my HSC major work for Software Design and Development and Information Processes and Technology.
It's a game where you have to go through a dungeon and rescue people and get armor, weapons and loot.
When you rescue people you can control them too to help you, and they all have different stats.
The game only has one level, as that's all that was needed, but I did spend quite some time on it, especially the pathfinding.

To run it, open with love2d or run one of the compiled branches.
